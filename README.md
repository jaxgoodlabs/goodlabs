# GoodLabs

GoodLabs is a hub for [commons-based peer production](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commons-Based_Peer_Production) providing creators and contributors with a community, personalized online workspaces, and data-driven insights to help them better understand and improve upon their operations.

## Background

People have shown a tremendous willingness to invest their free time and energy contributing to projects that don’t benefit them financially. This “[cognitive surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus)”–the free time that people have on their hands to engage in collaborative activities–has the potential to realize vast stores of social value that the traditional marketplace tends to neglect. 

Modern technologies like the internet, along with more recent innovations like distributed version control, have opened a pathway to more fully realize this value, but dependence on a still ad hoc, fragmented infrastructure means we’re not being as efficient or effective with this resource as we could be. 

This project is about removing the barriers that keep social production flowing at a trickle instead of a stream and providing a more robust, integrated core infrastructure to service this growing community of amateur creators and contributors.

## What is Social Production?

The term social production is used here to denote a mixture of the following to concepts:

> "Social production is found when people take the initiative to pose solutions to the problems arising from their living conditions. Partners in social production can be informal groups or local organizations, and/or other actors external to the community, such as NGOs, donors, private sector enterprises, cooperatives[1], professional associations, academics or government institutions, or any combination of these." ([Social Production of Habitat, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_production_of_habitat#:~:text=Social%20production%20is%20usually%20characterized,assets%20in%20the%20development%20process.))

> "Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated (usually with the aid of the internet) into large, meaningful projects, mostly without traditional hierarchical organization or financial compensation. He compares commons-based peer production to firm production (where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom) and market-based production (when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job).
