# GoodLabs

GoodLabs is a hub for [commons-based peer production](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commons-Based_Peer_Production) providing creators and contributors with a community, personalized online workspaces, and data-driven insights to help them better understand and improve upon their operations.

The development of the GoodLabs platform is a grassroots effort supported primarily through the [GoodLabs Community](https://www.sensorica.co/communities/goodlabs). Join us there to contribute to our effort!
